Packages that helped me enforce my personal JavaScript standards, which were
based on [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and the [Airbnb JavaScript Style
Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with some modifications.

This is not related to the similarly-named
[standard](https://github.com/standard/standard) project.

These packages are deprecated. I now use the default Prettier and Airbnb
settings instead.
